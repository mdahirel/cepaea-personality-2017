# Personality and shell morph in *Cepaea nemoralis* snails - output

The script will save various outputs here (models, big tables...) as `Rdata`to save you some time in the following runs.

If you don't have time to even do a first run (or if you want to use exactly the `Rdata` files we generated for the article), you can download them from the releases pages for this repository on GitHub.

Unzip so that all files are in this folder (not in any subfolder), and all should work.
